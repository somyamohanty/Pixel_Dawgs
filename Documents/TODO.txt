TODO List
1.	Finalize segmentation
2.	Finalize GUI
3.	Use GUI in conjuction with segmentation to manually tag ~4000 images
4.	Create a csv or some way to feed image id with list of points into a function
5.	Write code to take an image id with a list of points and reproduce segments 
6.	Create a feature vector for each tagged layer in the image (PCA or curve fitting?)
7.	Associate this feature vector with a list of tags
8.	Train a machine learning algorithm (KNN or SVM) with the feature vectors
9.	Take input image and segment, create a feature vector for each segment, use the machine learning algorithm to decide what to tag each segment

Unknowns
Is segmentation good enough?
Will PCA or curve fitting create a good enough feature vector?
Should we include edge response in the feature vector?
Should we use size as an additional metric that influences tag generation? (size of segment/size of image * probability?) (maybe weight towards one)
